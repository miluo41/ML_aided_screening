## Machine learning aided bacteria screening
### The central aim of this project was two fold:   
1. to substitute expensive, time-consuming chromatography protocols with scalable, albeit indirect, fluorescence-based method in metabolic screening.    
2. use machine learning to predict the outcome of a long-term experiment using the first few hours of initial measurements.  

The raw data in xlsx files were collected experimentally by Lemuel Soh and his cohort of undergrad helpers at UCLA.
