# ML_aided_screening
The central aim of this project was to substitute expensive, time-consuming chromatography protocols with scalable, albeit indirect, fluorescence-based method in metabolic screening. Several machine learning algorithms were applied to serve as a mapping tool between two approaches.
The raw data in xlsx files were collected experimentally by Lemuel Soh and his cohort of undergrad helpers at UCLA.
